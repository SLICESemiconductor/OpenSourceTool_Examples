append XSCHEM_LIBRARY_PATH :[pwd]
#### append any additional folders if needed:
# append XSCHEM_LIBRARY_PATH :/path/to/some/library

### customising my xterm setup (tried xterm for a few months, didnt like it. gnome-terminal much easier to view)
set terminal gnome-terminal
### increase font setting
#set terminal {xterm -fn 10x20}
#set terminal {xterm -fn 12x24}
# replace Insert key with i. The meaning is when 'i' is pressed translate it to Insert
set replace_key(i) Insert
# set gedit as my text editor. Note: -w option is required to force gedit to hang the xschem until it is closed.
# xschem needs this to be sure all gedits are finished before it proceeds with the simulation
set editor {gedit -w}
# I dont like gvim but below is the command. Note -f in gvim is equivalent to -w in gedit
#set editor {gvim -f}
# enable crosshair function which I never use
#set draw_crosshair 1
# set grid axis (undecided if I want to use this or not!)
set draw_grid_axes 0 
# add the following setting to have the schematic centered in the window instead of aligned on the bottom
set zoom_full_center 1
# replace stim file edit (Shift+Q) with d. Reason is I keep mixing it up with Ctrl+Q and exit out of xschem by mistake!
set replace_key(d) Shift-Q
